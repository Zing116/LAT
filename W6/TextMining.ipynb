       "'The article discusses the current state of virtual reality (VR) technologies and applications and their use in product design and decision-making processes. The author refers to a seminal paper by Fred Brooks, a virtual reality pioneer, who concluded that VR had finally arrived in 1999. The article presents the results of a survey conducted among 18 companies using VR via on-site visits and remote conference calls. The survey highlights the maturity, stability, and usability of VR technologies and their active use in various industries. The article also provides an overview of the core VR technologies that enable people to experience a virtual environment, particularly displays for sight, hearing, and touch.Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that simulates a virtual environment that can be interacted with using various devices such as head-mounted displays, handheld controllers, and haptic devices. VR experiences are created through a combination of hardware components such as displays, tracking systems, and audio displays. The primary goal of VR is to produce a sense of presence within the virtual environment, which can be achieved by mimicking how humans perceive and process information from the world around them. The idea of VR was first conceived by Ivan Sutherland in 1965, and since then, the technology has seen significant growth and adoption.The article describes the history of virtual reality technology, including its origins in the 1960s and the development of hardware and software advances in the following decades. It discusses the growing interest in the use of VR technology in industry and summarizes surveys and research on topics such as motion capture, haptics, and tracking systems. The article concludes by noting that virtual reality research has flourished in recent years, with contributions from both the academic and industrial communities.The article discusses how virtual reality (VR) has been adopted in various industries to serve different needs. While there have been technical challenges associated with VR, many have been overcome, and the technology is now mature, stable, and usable. The article reports on an NSF-sponsored research project that aimed to understand how industry is using VR to empower innovation and help people make decisions through a survey of on-site interviews with VR practitioners. The survey focused on applications where real users are using VR for experienced benefits, and the authors adopted the definition of VR put forth by Brooks (1999). The article concludes that VR has enabled people to make decisions in new ways and presents motivating questions and future research directions in this area.The article discusses a survey conducted to better understand the current state of virtual reality (VR) applications and technology in industries, specifically in aiding decision-making for product design processes.

       "'This paper presents a system for tracking a hand-held camera in an AR workspace without any prior map or known objects. The system splits tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer. One thread tracks erratic hand-held motion while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate with high accuracy and robustness.This article explores a new approach to AR (augmented reality) that uses a generated map as a sandbox for virtual simulations, rather than relying on a prior map to create meaningful augmentations. The system estimates a dominant plane from the mapped points and allows it to be populated with virtual characters, essentially turning any flat surface into a playing field for VR simulations. The article outlines the proposed method and contrasts it with previous methods, with a focus on camera tracking and mapping. The system is designed to be used in small, mostly static environments, making it suitable for workspace-related AR applications.The article discusses a new approach for mapping and tracking a single hand-held camera using the 5-Point Algorithm. The approach separates the tracking and mapping processes, allowing for more robust tracking methods and the ability to use only keyframes for mapping. The use of bundle adjustment also provides a more accurate mapping method. The article compares this approach to current state-of-the-art systems and argues for the benefits of a split between tracking and mapping.The article discusses a new method for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using SfM (Structure-from-Motion) techniques. It compares and contrasts its approach with other SLAM methods, such as those that use particle filters, image descriptors, and batch techniques. The article highlights the advantages of its approach, which includes building a long-term map and constantly revisiting features. The article also mentions previous work that attempts to improve the robustness of monocular SLAM and extensible tracking using batch techniques. Lastly, the article compares its approach with recent work that uses SfM techniques to map and track unknown environments.The document explains a point-based augmented reality system that uses a handheld camera and a map of 3D points to track and overlay graphics on the real-world environment in real-time. The system operates in two stages: tracking and mapping. The map is a collection of M point features that represent locally planar textured patches in the world. Each keyframe stores a pyramid of greyscale images, and each point feature stores a reference to a single source keyframe and source pyramid level. The point-based tracking system receives images from the camera and maintains a real-time estimate of the camera pose relative to the built map to enable the overlay of graphics on the real-world environment.'"

       "\"of a study on self-determination theory and the three basic psychological needs of humans. The study employed a 2x2x2 factorial design within a game-learning experience to predict rated need satisfaction, mood, motivation, and objective game performance. The study found that manipulated competence and relatedness support had main effects on most outcomes, and rated competence, relatedness, and autonomy need satisfaction also predicted the outcomes. The significant experimental main effects were all mediated by the corresponding rated variables. The findings offer new support for key postulates of SDT and integrate the correlational and experimental traditions in this area. The study tested key tenets of SDT in a way they have not been tested before, via an experimental manipulation of all three needs.This passage discusses self-determination theory (SDT), which explains how people's intrinsic motivation can be either supported or undermined in different social-contextual settings. SDT suggests that people are more likely to be intrinsically motivated when they feel a sense of autonomy, competence, and relatedness within a task setting. Over the years, SDT researchers have conducted numerous studies manipulating autonomy support and have shown consistent effects on intrinsic motivation. However, compared to autonomy, competence and relatedness needs have been rarely manipulated as experimental factors. Instead, researchers have typically measured satisfaction of these three needs via self-report and found that these three needs are important for predicting people's positive mood, well-being, and thriving.The article discusses the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and the importance of three needs - autonomy, competence, and relatedness - on individual functioning and well-being. While past research supports the importance of all three needs in predicting positive outcomes, the use of self-report data has been criticized. The article sets out to conduct an experimental study to validate the SDT proposal and explore the possibility of interactions between the needs. The study aims to provide specific information on the types of outcomes affected by each need.The study aimed to investigate how psychological needs satisfaction affects intrinsic motivation and actual performance in a game-learning context. The game chosen was Boggle, and participants were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions that varied the utterances of the experimenter during introductory, learning, and performance phases. The dependent measures were rated satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs, mood, self-reported intrinsic motivation, and willingness to recommend the experiment, as well as objective game scores during the performance phase, controlling for scholastic aptitude. Participants were 196 introductory psychology students at the University of Missouri, who participated to fulfill a course requirement. The study could give insight into trade-offs that occur when social contexts prioritize satisfaction of one need at the expense of another.The study aimed to investigate the effects of autonomy support, competence support, and relatedness support on task performance and motivation. Participants were randomly assigned to one of eight conditions and given a pre-test and post-test grid task. The autonomy support condition emphasized choice and self-direction, while the non-autonomy conditions emphasized experimenter control and the absence of choice. The competence and relatedness support manipulations were based on past research and conceptual definitions. A ninth control group was also included for comparison. The results were analyzed by considering the number and length of valid words listed by participants. The study found that autonomy support, competence support, and relatedness support all had positive effects on task performance and motivation.\""
